A general toolbox containing the main algorithms for regular and subregular language classes. It also contains an implementation of the OSTIA algorithm (subsequential transducers), together with two probabilistic finite state automata algorithms (ALERGIA and MDI). This work was developed by Hasan Ibne Akram and Huang Xiao .
